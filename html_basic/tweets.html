        <h3>My friend and I would like to work as web developers</h3>
        <p>Wow, I have started working on my first webpage at ALU. Coding is a lot of fun!</p>
        <p>I firmly believe in taking on challenges, therefore with the skills I'm picking up at ALU, I expect to accomplish a lot!</p>
        <P>I'm urging my peers to take HTML classes because it takes a lot of effort to comprehend.</P>
        <p>Additionally, I'll make sure to turn it into a career!</p>
